# LogisticRegression_Algorithm
This is an implementation of one of the most widely used algorithm  in ML,specifically for Classification. In this implementation, I explored the case of binary classification,using gradient descent. In the file train.py I tested my Algorithm on the breast-cancer dataset from scikit learn.
